The offer price of $40.00 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of Bank of America's common stock exceeding $40.00 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless this condition is waived by Tutanota, Bank of America shareholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. Tutanota can extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, May 31, 2024."
